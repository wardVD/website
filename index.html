            <p>Physicist gone rogue. After doing my PhD in experimental particle physics at the University in Ghent I started
                out as a machine learning engineer. Aside from tampering with the ML models themselves I enjoy optimizing the
                processes of getting these models into production and being of <span class="emphasized">real</span> value for users.
